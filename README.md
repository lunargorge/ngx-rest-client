# ngx-rest-client

Library to facilitate the use of [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) in applications based on the Angular framework.
ngx-rest-client uses [json2entity](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json2entity) to create entities that represent data.

Of course, the library can easily be adapted to cooperate with other production rest services.

Installation: 

$ npm install json2entity --save  
$ npm install ngx-rest-client --save
